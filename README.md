# GTH-DUBAI

It was a fiverr project. Basically it was a property related application. It had 4 ends, salesperson, broker, manager and admin. Admin could see allÂ  the account requests and could approve them. The admin and manager could see all the property related requests (sale, rent etc) made by salesperson and brokers and could process the request. The request goes throgh 5 stages before it gets completed. Mostly it was lots and lots of communication between the front end application and the backend APIs.
